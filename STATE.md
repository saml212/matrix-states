# STATE — Current Project State

## DAY BRIEFING — 2026-07-10 (the quotable summary; supersedes 07-09's below)

**Verdicts of record landed:** (1) **H2H AXIS-1 WIN AT n=3** (§1.40) —
contender recall 0.9995-1.0 every seed vs baselines at chance, CIs
exclude the 0.30 margin 3×+, single-seed caveat RETIRED; task2 =
trainability-variance (one fresh seed cleared — diagnosis round
pre-registered); M* (axis 2) in flight. (2) **Stage-2 composer
EXONERATED** (§2.26) — the fla cross-check's 140× failure was fla's
transpose state convention (composer matches the closed form at
4.5e-08); Arm-1 retrained 5/5; the 11-cell calibration gate RAN
overnight (harvest in flight → the 57-cell sweep decision). (3) **The
fix-at-scale wave COMPLETED + HARVESTED — §13.22 VERDICT: PARTIAL at
both scales** (realized ≈130.2 GPU-h of the 281 committed): the
per_token arm's destabilizing 14M sign PERSISTS (attenuated) at 98M
both corpora + 392M-wikitext, nulls at 392M-openr1, reverses NOWHERE;
the global-vector probe's 14M stabilization does NOT transfer (weak at
98M, ≈zero/sign-flipped at 392M); val-loss neutrality PASSES everywhere
— **no tested frozen-bias construction stabilizes the attractor at
scale**; flagship row R8 landed. **Outage disclosure:** session limits knocked the coordinator
out twice (net Thu ~8:20pm PT → Fri ~9:15am PT); the box finished its
queues unattended (tmux isolation working as designed); one agent
transcript was lost and its work reconstructed from the on-disk
papers/ state (the paper skill's repo-mode doing its job). **Paper
program:** Jul-11 EAs in final fixes (submission package = the PI's
titles/authors call); flagship brief now evidence-complete INCLUDING
row R8 (§13.22 verdict landed 2026-07-10); paper skill v2 portable + live on
platform-skills main 054d7bf; pebbleml.com carries the ICML paper + 5
findings pages incl. the n=3 recall verdict.

## DAY BRIEFING — 2026-07-09 (evening; the quotable summary)

**Five banked results, all gauntlet-hardened and pushed:** (1) **THE
RANK-LAW TRILOGY, 5/5 COMPLETE** (§1.33/§1.36/§1.36a): correlation
ρ=0.9747 (tie-capped max), marquee S4-vs-A5 dimension-not-solvability
TOST, and the causal razor — recovery is a step function at exactly
d_min in all five groups, with the necessity side exactly 0.000 across
all seeds tested; total cost ≈4.3 GPU-h. (2) **H2H ROUND 4 = TASK1-
PRIMARY LEG-A WIN at n=1** (§1.37): contender recall 0.9990 vs
0.0447/0.0295 baselines (>3× the pre-registered margin), S₀ hard-stop
PASSED (recall provably fast-weight-resident), Leg-B anchor reproduced
±0.001; **HARVESTED 2026-07-10: the 27-cell n=3 sweep CONFIRMS — AXIS-1
TASK1-PRIMARY LEG-A WIN at n=3 under the frozen tiers** (contender
0.9995 mean, every seed ≥10.7× the bar; Δ vs ablation CI (0.958, 0.973),
Δ vs transformer CI (0.969, 0.974), both exclude the 0.30 margin; no
seed fragility, extension trigger silent; task2 surprise: 1/3 contender
seeds shows partial recall 0.334 → INDETERMINATE, opens the diagnosis
round; §1.40 = the verdict of record). (3) **qk-norm EXONERATED at n=3** (0.05σ)
— the attractor is not the known artifact; gating amplification =
direction-consistent trend, NOT confirmed at the bar (1.92σ, p=0.062),
folded into iclr-2027 with that framing. (4) **The S₀ mechanism
discovery**: bindings live entirely in block-0's fast-weight state,
stored nonlinearly, linearized by the model's own forward pass —
explains all three earlier calibration "failures" (wrong-layer
instrument). (5) **Fix-at-scale wave LIVE**: pins written + verified,
post_pin flood on GPUs 2-7 (~250 GPU-h through the coming days) — the
per_token-vs-global geometry-transfer verdict at 98M/392M. Paper
vehicles: capability-ws-2026/RANK_LAW_SKELETON.md new; iclr-2027
terminology + robustness folds landed; **PI decisions queued: Jul 11
NeurReps/UniReps EAs, 5 late-add emails, Jul 19 COLM.** Gauntlet
receipts today: two wave-killing FATALs, a rank-tax instrument defect,
a vacuous rung, a wrong-layer instrument, a mis-derived tolerance band,
and a pre-registration ambiguity — all caught BEFORE compute was
wasted. Session-limit outage 01:15-08:54 PT disclosed (box unaffected).

**Last updated:** 2026-07-09 (new-sprint consolidation; per-event history
lives in `EXPERIMENT_LOG.md`, the design docs' § sections, `experiment-runs/`
archives, and git history — see "Documentation Map" at the end of this
file. This pass compressed the prior event-stack narrative into the
ACTIVE CAMPAIGNS section below; nothing was deleted — every compressed
block still has a pointer to its canonical design-doc record.)

## GOALS

1. **Publish the drafted material.** One paper PUBLISHED ("The Gradient
   Does Not See Rank", ICML 2026 MI workshop). Drafts: `neurips-ws-2026/`
   (positive rank results; venue+cut decision pending, ~Jul 11 CFP —
   IMMINENT), `workshop-2026/` (capacity trilogy), `iclr-2027/` (the
   full main-conference paper, complete draft, deadline ~late Sept 2026).
2. **Multi-workshop strategy (PI, 2026-07-08):** chop the result
   inventory into many workshop submissions beyond the two dated ones
   (reasoning-link null program, instrument-calibration/fake-cliff
   methodology story, the coming M* memory result, the coming
   capability-separation result). A venue-scout agent maintains the CFP
   pipeline.
3. **Land a full (main-conference) publication.** The ICLR 2027 draft is
   the vehicle; PI wants Berkeley/Stanford collaboration; PI publishes it
   regardless, but it needs a POSITIVE result to matter.
4. **The overall research goal (PI, verbatim intent, 2026-07-08):**
   demonstrate CAPABILITIES current architectures are incapable of,
   functionally or as observed/tested — capability SEPARATION, not
   efficiency, is the world-changing headline. Matched comparisons (the
   head-to-head) remain the grounding. Modality (language/bytes/other)
   is an open question, settled by the waterfall, never bundled
   two-unproven-axes-at-once.
5. **GPU saturation (PI, verbatim, 2026-07-09):** *"how will [we]
   ensure that all these 8 gpu's are hot for the next few days. I
   don't want these sitting idle anymore."* Queued science totalled
   ~20 GPU-h against ≈192 GPU-h/day supply — the pipeline's cells were
   too small to saturate. Response (the authorization the
   never-self-amend rule requires): two compute-heavy waves chartered
   (FIX-AT-SCALE, CAPABILITY STAGE 2, both below) plus liberal
   pre-registered seed extensions; all 8 GPUs in play, GPU 7 no longer
   reserved.

## ACTIVE CAMPAIGNS

### 1. Head-to-Head Demo (PI-ratified 2026-07-08)

Does a matrix-native fast-weight model (frozen-bias fix + recruitable
rank + super-linear capacity + exact composition) beat matched
baselines on data-efficiency (primary 1) and inference-memory-matched
long-horizon tasks (primary 2), FLOP-matched as a disclosed control
only? Registry: `matrix-thinking/HEAD_TO_HEAD_DEMO_DESIGN.md`. Design
cleared after 4 attack-round/revision cycles (§1.13-§1.19,
DESIGN-CLEARED-FOR-BUILD) → build → audit → deploy → calibration
rounds 1-2, both FAILED (gate-1 `rf@0.9`=0 all arms; the pre-registered
`aux_weight` dial [0.1→2.0] achieved gradient parity but every arm
plateaued) → **§1.21 diagnosis: the objective had no recall pressure**
— CE is structurally retrieval-blind (each key appears once at bind
time, queries never enter CE) and the aux loss converged to an
episode-membership local optimum (predicted-vector cosine matches the
analytic `1/√K` ceiling exactly in every arm — the "membership-oracle"
finding) → **Rev 4** adopted a three-term objective (answer-token CE at
the query position, all three arms symmetric, P=1 bottleneck preserved
by causality via the continuation construction) → **§1.23 attack round
5: CLEARED-FOR-BUILD-FIX** (fairness adjudicated axis-1-immune; ledger
gap reconciled) → build-fix (`cc89a4f`; an import-chain bug found and
fixed, `1db9594`) → **§1.24 scoped build-fix audit: RESIDUAL-FINDINGS**
— fix logic sound, but the CE_answer continuation wastefully runs the
50,259-way LM head over all 128 padded positions before discarding
127/128 (AUD2-F1, MAJOR, ≈4× the priced round-3 cost), and one
precision test is missing (AUD2-F2, K-restricted-argmax not defended).
**STATUS: PRE-LAUNCH FIX ACTIVE** (LM-head slice-before-matmul + a
fresh on-box timing pilot to re-price round 3 and the 27-cell sweep);
**calibration round 3 PENDING**. Margin freeze is additionally blocked
on the fix-at-scale campaign's escalation-cost correction and its
global-vector-arm probe (item 4 below) before the contender pin is
final — see PENDING PI DECISIONS.

**UPDATE (2026-07-09, later same day):** round 3 completed → the
two-leg gate (Rev 5, §1.31) → §1.32 micro-attack (Rev 5.1 fix) →
build-fix (§1.31.4 items 1-6, `7c7acd5`) → audit (§1.34: 1 BLOCKING +
2 MAJOR, narrow fixes `5107638`) → deploy chain dispatched (§1.35) →
**HALTED at box-smoke item [11]** (real K=48 peak 6.14 GiB vs the
pre-registered 2 GiB bound, 3.07x over, `experiment-runs/
2026-07-09_h2h_round4_launch/`) → **diagnosed+fixed same day**:
`transformer_native_tap`'s B*Q mega-batch (32 episodes x 48 full-K
queries at eval) drove the Transformer's own FFN/RoPE forward
activations, not the LM head (§1.33/§1.35 had mis-cited the LM-head-only
figure as covering the whole call); row-chunked the tap
(bit-identical, proven via `smoke_11`) → item 11 now passes at 1.05 GiB
(1.9x headroom, deterministic x2) → identity-table pre-flight verified
→ **ROUND 4 LAUNCHED** (tmux `h2h_round4`, GPU 0, `H2H_DIAL_ROUND=4`);
watch `results/h2h_rung1/round4/ROUND4_SUMMARY.json` on the box. Full
record: `HEAD_TO_HEAD_DEMO_DESIGN.md` §1.36[h2h].

**UPDATE (2026-07-10, harvest — THE VERDICT OF RECORD, §1.40):** round 4
= Leg-A WIN at n=1 (§1.37) → ladder/bands PASS + MARGINS_FROZEN
21:38:00Z + 27-cell sweep launched (§1.38) → sweep completed clean
(27/27, no FATALs, 9.598 GPU-h vs 13.25 ceiling) → harvested. The
Stage-D script trained cells only, so the verdict-grade `acc_A` reads
were produced at harvest via the audited round-4 re-metric driver on
the 18 grammar `_r4.pt` checkpoints (independent pre-run audit
CLEAR-TO-RUN; 0.112 GPU-h). **AXIS-1 TASK1-PRIMARY = LEG-A WIN at
n=3:** contender [0.99951, 1.00000, 0.99902] vs ablation
[0.03223, 0.03271, 0.03687] vs transformer [0.02710, 0.02930, 0.02856];
Δ(cont−abl) CI (0.95822, 0.97293), Δ(cont−tfm) CI (0.96855, 0.97383) —
both exclude the frozen 0.30 margin; every contender seed ≥10.7× the
demonstration bar; the n=3→9 extension trigger does NOT fire; the
single-seed caveat is RETIRED (Nichani + matched-budget caveats stand).
S₀ hard-stop clean 12/12 (one disclosed σ=0-at-ceiling instrument edge
case at s1). **Task2 SURPRISE:** contender s2 = 0.33447 clears the bar
(s0/s1 + all baselines at chance) → strict tiers read INDETERMINATE;
the pre-registered joint-failure-TIE rationale doesn't transfer to
fresh seeds — the s2 datum opens the TASK2 DIAGNOSIS ROUND
(trainability/seed-variance, not a hard capability boundary). Public
caveat page + flagship brief R4 updated with the verdict. **NEXT
(pre-registered): the M\* protocol (axis 2, two §1.38 pre-flight items
+ the σ=0 note), task2 diagnosis round, transformer_K48 stress cell.**
Archive: `experiment-runs/2026-07-10_h2h_sweep_harvest/` (+SSD).

### 2. Capability Separation — Stage 1 (PI capability-first directive, 2026-07-08)

Does causal rank↔representation-dimension recruitment separate
solvable/non-solvable finite groups at matched dims (S4-vs-A5
dissociation, both dim 3)? Registry:
`matrix-thinking/CAPABILITY_SEPARATION_DESIGN.md`. Design cleared after
5 attack rounds (§1.21) → build → audit → deploy → calibration (5/5
cells, 0.0179 GPU-h/cell) → a gate-1 review found A5/A6 apparently
under-converged and real-checkpoint degauging near-zero (mean_cos
−0.02..0.17) while a synthetic injection PASSED → **§1.25 diagnosis:
TWO instrument defects proven, models healthy.** Defect 1 (FATAL): the
uncentered covariance-SVD is mathematically degenerate for Option A
targets (`Z≈c·(ρ⊕I)` orthogonal ⇒ `ZZᵀ≈c²·I`, isotropic) — a PERFECT
model fails the production bars; fixed by centering (group-mean of a
nontrivial irrep cancels the constant block). Defect 2 (FATAL): M1/M3's
scored words fell exclusively on `nn.Embedding` positional rows that
never train at the pinned lengths. **Corrected-lens rank preview: rank
tracks `d_min` at Spearman ρ=0.9747** (restricted effective rank
1.85/2.74/2.64/3.73/3.91-4.54 vs `d_min` 2/3/3/4/5, every group inside
`[0.7,1.3]·d_min`, the marquee S4/A5 pair landing together). **CAVEAT**
(standing): the restriction window partially favors rank≈`d_min` for
near-orthogonal blocks; M3's causal force-rank arms remain the decisive
test. → Rev 5 (fixes folded in) → micro attack round 6 (§1.27,
NEEDS-REVISION: the new per-L convergence bar is self-contradicted by
the real calibration data) → Rev 6 (§1.28: bar narrowed to `L∈{1..5}`,
`L∈{6..8}` demoted to disclosed-only, a second-consecutive-miss
HARD-STOP rule added) → **§1.29 coordinator raw-data tiebreak: round
6's "all 7 cells clear L1-5" claim is FALSE against the raw JSON;
Rev 6's structural fix is correct, but the HARD-STOP it triggered fired
on a wrong premise** — the L=1 dip is real but IMPROVING with budget
(A5 +0.038, A6 +0.059, 8K→20K steps), i.e. slow convergence, not a
plateau → adjudication round 7 dispatched (bar re-pin options + a
≤0.1 GPU-h L=1 mechanism micro-diagnostic). **§1.30 ROUND 7 VERDICT
(2026-07-09): MECHANISM FOUND, proven five independent ways — at L=1
the reader's attention is PROVABLY query-independent (softmax over a
single key; read-vector std across queries = exactly 0.0 vs 0.41 at
L=2); the deficit is generator-order-specific (order-5 depressed
0.74-0.86, order-3 fine); §1.29's own budget-extrapolation is
FALSIFIED at 40K (A5/A6 gains collapse to +0.001/+0.010 per +20K
steps — a genuine plateau, not slow convergence after all).
**HARD-STOP LIFTED.** Rev 7 (binding): HARD bar → `L∈{2..5}` only
(L=1 demoted/disclosed with the mechanism note); per-group budget pins
(S3=8K, S4=20K, A5=20K, S5=8K, A6=40K, all clearing their bar by
≥0.02 margin); escalation rule recalibrated (≤2/group, second miss →
mandatory mechanism diagnostic before any further action, HARD-STOP
reserved for genuine pathology). **STATUS: Rev 7 folded (9245aa4) + all 4
production items BUILT (f8f503e, 13/13 smoke) → INDEPENDENT BUILD AUDIT
RETURNED (2026-07-09 overnight): NEEDS-FIXES, narrow — no production
defect; 3 test-teeth gaps (worst: the §1.25-DEFECT-2 eval-sampler
regression passes the whole suite silently) + 1 archive-provenance gap →
F1-F4 teeth fixes LANDED (27c97a1) → **DEPLOY + CALIBRATION RE-CHECK
COMPLETE (2026-07-09): all 5 calibration cells (S3/S4/A5/S5/A6) clear
gate 1(a)'s HARD bar on the FIRST measurement at the Rev-7 pinned budgets
(margins 0.0267-0.0825, all ≥0.02), gate-1(b) ambient injection PASSES on
the deployed production path (centered 0.9996/uncentered 0.7053, matching
S1.25's cited figures), box smoke 13/13. Realized 0.2039 GPU-h. GATE
VERDICT: SWEEP-READY — no escalation/routing needed. Full record:
EXPERIMENT_LOG.md 2026-07-09 entry; archive
`experiment-runs/2026-07-09_capability_calib_recheck/`.** `--sweep`
itself still separately gates on the GPU-h projection under the 30 GPU-h
cap and `CAPABILITY_SEP_PI_SIGNOFF=1`. **LAUNCHED (2026-07-09, §1.32
authorization, `experiment-runs/2026-07-09_capability_sweep_launch/`):**
md5 re-verified clean (no redeploy needed), no stale pre-Rev-7 results
lingered, gate passed (measured rate 0.0408 GPU-h/cell → 4.62 GPU-h
projection, cap 30.0 — the code's own crude uniform-rate gate; the
design doc's finer group-weighted estimate stays ≈2.51 GPU-h, both
comfortably under cap), tmux `cap_sweep` on GPU 0 only. First cells
confirmed healthy: unconstrained-arm cells converge near-zero loss;
the `S3__k_dmin` force-rank arm (M3's decisive causal test) converges
to a stable ≈0.293 plateau — read at launch as the expected
capacity-bound signature (the harvest showed it was in fact the exact
√(k/d_state) D-AMB ceiling, below). Chained (same supervisor, automatic
fallthrough, dry-run verified pre-launch): the campaign-3 2×2 n=3
escalation fired immediately after the sweep's `STOP` marker landed,
same GPU 0. **HARVESTED (2026-07-09, §1.33; archive
`experiment-runs/2026-07-09_capability_sweep_harvest/`, verify-vs-raws
61/61 md5-exact, all aggregates recomputed from per-cell JSONs via the
repo's own pre-registered `tost_analysis.py` machinery). STAGE-1
VERDICT: INCONCLUSIVE — DIAGNOSED (D-AMB).** M1 CONFIRM: restricted
eff-rank tracks d_min essentially perfectly (1.877/2.852/2.832/3.591/
4.736 for d_min 2/3/3/4/5; all 19 unconstrained cells in-band per-seed;
Spearman ρ=0.9747 = the tie-capped maximum). Marquee S4-vs-A5 TOST:
**DECLARE** (diff +0.019 rank-units, t≈13-14 vs tcrit 1.87) — the pair
lands together (dimension), not apart (solvability). M3 (the decisive
causal test): FAILS-TO-CONFIRM at all 5 groups, NO hard falsify —
k=d_min−1 cleanly near-chance everywhere, but recovery never returns at
k∈{d_min, d_min+1} either, because `groups.py`'s `eye(d_state)` target
padding makes the as-built target rank d_state (all σ=1): capped arms
trained to their exact √(k/d_state) ceiling (37/39 cells within 0.07,
mean |Δ|=0.028) and spent ~2 ranks on the constant ambient identity
first (restricted rank ≈ k−2), so NO capped arm ever delivered
effective rho-rank ≥ d_min — the CONFIRM half of M3 was never
purchased. Instrument defect (D-AMB, proven five ways in §1.33), not
evidence against recruitment. M2: build gap (no checkpoints persisted);
n=1 proxy knees at k*=d_state corroborate D-AMB. Realized 2.5907 GPU-h
all-58 (campaign ≈3.36/30). **§1.11's diagnosed-INCONCLUSIVE gate arm
is DISCHARGED — Stage-2 build dispatch formally unblocked (§2.18);
a cheap tax-free M3 re-run (~28 cells ≈1.3-2.6 GPU-h, two pre-specified
fix variants in §1.33) is the registered next wave before any Stage-1
paper claim.** **M3 FIX WAVE: BUILT (b07d2b6, §1.34 — variant B
necessarily 2-point, grid amendment recorded) → AUDIT CLEARED (§1.35,
8/8 mutations caught + the C1 crosscheck-metric pin pre-registered
before launch) → LAUNCHED (tmux `m3fix_wave`, GPU 0, 30 cells n=1) →
HARVESTED (2026-07-09, §1.36; archive
`experiment-runs/2026-07-09_m3fix_harvest/`, 33/33 md5-exact, A3
config-match CLEAN vs an independent-literal manifest). VERDICT:
CAUSAL-CONFIRM** — with the ambient tax removed, k=d_min−1 FAILS at
all 5 groups (xrec90 exactly 0.000, xcos under the 0.894 oracle bound)
and k=d_min RECOVERS to anchor class in 4/5 groups INCLUDING BOTH
marquee members (S4 0.800/anchor 0.650; A5 0.700/0.700; S5 0.600/0.500;
A6 0.650/0.650), k=d_min+1 recovers everywhere; the old √(k/d_state)
climb signature is ABSENT (step function at d_min instead). Variant B
corroborates the tax mechanism (eff-rank d_min−1 fails at 0.000,
tax-paid point recovers 0.500-0.850). The scale-only primary diverged
exactly as the §1.35 oracle injection predicted — the C1 pin was
load-bearing. S3 was the one below-bar group (0.450 vs 0.495 bar,
inside the pre-stated ±0.05 marginality trigger) → a 3-seed S3
extension was ROUTED before S3 could be quoted as a confirm group; the
overall verdict didn't depend on it. The Stage-1 rank-law trilogy
(M1 ρ=0.9747 + marquee DECLARE + M3 causal razor) is COMPLETE —
the flagship claim's decisive leg is banked. Realized 1.4235 GPU-h
vs 1.3324 priced (+6.8%, eval overhead). **S3 SEED-PARAMETERIZATION
EXTENSION (§1.36a, 2026-07-09): BUILT (`ccd7d39` — parameterized

(zero-noise necessity leg). The Stage-1 rank-law causal trilogy now

### 3. Attractor-Robustness 2×2 (novelty stress-test follow-on, 2026-07-09)

A PI-skepticism-driven novelty stress-test asked the dangerous question
about the write-geometry attractor directly: is it just the well-known
qk-norm eigenvalue-stability issue in disguise? **Verdict:
HOLDS-WITH-NARROWED-SCOPE.** Every run used `use_qk_l2norm_in_kernel=
True` throughout (code-verified, `lm_pretrain_rd.py:984` — the same
stock mitigation Kimi Linear arXiv:2510.26692 §4 and Qwen3-Next cite);
qk-norm conditions single-vector eigenvalue stability, the attractor is
cross-key POPULATION geometry — a different axis — and two stronger
interventions (Gram penalty, ZCA whitening) already failed to fix it.
Follow-on funded: a 2×2 qk-norm×gating screen at 14M. **Built**
(`55f0cfc`: flag-gated `use_qk_l2norm_in_kernel`/`gated_delta_active`
axes in `lm_pretrain_rd.py`, additive and off-by-default). **Audit-
corrected** (`f09254a`): the escalation trigger's noise-floor constant
had silently pooled 4 out-of-distribution probe corpora instead of the
same-corpus statistic (`build_tidy.py:22`), understating
openr1-mix-ext's true seed noise by 2.65×, biasing screening toward
false-positive escalation on pure noise; recomputed directly from raw
archived JSONs (openr1-mix-ext 2.244355, wikitext-mix-ext 2.216699,
population std ddof=0); `rec@0.9` marked explicitly NON-DECISIONAL in
the report schema. **Deployed**: 145-file box sync EMPTY-DIFF
(`experiment-runs/2026-07-09_attractor_2x2_deploy/SYNC_RECORD.md`).
Box smokes ALL PASS — item [18]'s gated-arm backward initially failed
on Hopper/Triton≥3.4 (fla issue #640, wrong-result path) and required
provisioning the `tilelang` backend on-box (env-only fix, no kernel
code touched; the default non-gated path stays on the same Triton
kernels every prior chapter used, unaffected). **STATUS: screening
COMPLETE + HARVESTED (2026-07-09 overnight, commit 634017c; 4/4 cells
clean, 1.03 GPU-h vs 1.01 ceiling, verify-vs-raws bit-exact). VERDICT:
SPLITS-ON-AN-AXIS.** The attractor PERSISTS in all 4 cells — no
soft-fix candidate, no contradiction of 06_soft_fixes_fail. qk-norm-off
is a within-noise null (−0.87 gram-dev = 0.39σ vs the corrected
2.244355 floor): **the attractor is NOT a qk-norm artifact — the direct
data answer to the PI's Kimi/Qwen skepticism.** Gating moves deviation
UP in both arms — +6.16 (2.75σ, TRIGGER) in the qk-on arm,
concentrating collapse in layer 0 (stable-rank 4.34→3.14; train
rank_L0 31.3→5.8) — while IMPROVING val loss (2.15→1.98): gated,
production-style models carry the pathology WORSE while looking
healthier on loss. rec@0.9 uniformly at the PROBE-INVALID floor,
NON-DECISIONAL as pre-registered. **Escalation FIRES per the
pre-registered rule** (|+6.16| > 2×2.244 = 4.489): 12-cell n=3,
resume-safe → only 8 new cells ≈2.02 GPU-h incremental, ceiling 3.03.
**CHAINED (2026-07-09) behind the capability-sep 58-cell sweep on GPU 0**
— same tmux supervisor, automatic fallthrough (no separate dispatch),
wiring dry-run-verified before launch (`--dry-run` against live box
state confirmed budget_guard passes at 3.0288/3.03 GPU-h, the 4 existing
screening cells resume-skip, the 8 new s1/s2 cells carry the correct
per-combo flags). See `experiment-runs/2026-07-09_capability_sweep_launch/`.
**n=3 HARVESTED (2026-07-09; archive `experiment-runs/
2026-07-09_attrrob_2x2_escalation_harvest/`, verify-vs-raws 63/63
md5-exact, runner AGGREGATE reproduced to <1e-6). VERDICT: gating-
amplifies NOT CONFIRMED at the pre-registered bar** — the n=1 +6.16
(2.75σ) shrank to **+4.31 mean = 1.92σ_floor < 4.489** at n=3
(runner's own `escalation.fire=false` agrees); direction HOLDS in all
3 paired seeds (+6.16/+3.12/+3.65; exploratory Welch t p=0.062) —
recorded as a direction-consistent TREND, neither confirmed
amplification nor null; the n=1 caveats STAND. **qk-norm exoneration
HOLDS at n=3** (−0.10 = 0.05σ) — the PI's Kimi/Qwen skepticism answer
is now n=3-solid. qk-off×gated +1.13 = 0.50σ. Gated arms still train
to lower loss every seed (3.515 vs 3.682). Realized 1.97 GPU-h (8 new
legs; ≈2.04 wall) vs 2.02 projected / 3.03 ceiling. **iclr-2027
consequence: the angles-4/5 fold is NOT unblocked in its strong form
(the "full discharge on the n=3 confirm" condition FAILED); any fold
must carry the trend-not-confirmed n=3 numbers — the qk-norm
exoneration remains fully foldable.** Campaign CLOSED unless the
paper-pass or PI funds an n>3 extension (a ≥2σ-at-n=3-mean effect
would need either more seeds or a pre-registered paired test).

### 4. Fix-at-Scale (PI GPU-saturation charter, 2026-07-09)

Trains the frozen-bias fix (per-token, λ=0.58, literal transplant of
rung-1's construction) at 98M and 392M, extending its ONLY training
evidence (14M-only today) up the same ladder the write-geometry
pathology is already measured on (span_frac 0.248→0.344→0.389→0.455,
14M→1.31B). Registry: `matrix-thinking/FROZEN_BIAS_LM_DESIGN.md` §13.
**Wrong-direction-fix flag, stated up front by the design itself:** the
per-token fix's own 14M evidence is NOT stabilizing — it moved OPPOSITE
the mechanism prediction (span_frac +0.1955/+0.2273, CI-excludes-zero,
MORE collapsed than the artifact-matched control); only the
never-scaled GLOBAL-VECTOR arm actually stabilized it (−0.3319/−0.2308,
CI-excludes-zero). Three pre-registered, equally-publishable outcomes
(WIN = per-token reverses to the mechanism-predicted direction at
scale; PARTIAL = the destabilizing pattern persists on ≥1 corpus; NULL
= CI includes zero both scales) — a repeat of the 14M sign is itself
informative, not assumed away. Explicitly does NOT invoke §6.2's formal
rung-2 gate (rung-1 read as the FOURTH OUTCOME, "sim-training
divergence," never a CONFIRM) — authorized on a separate basis (the
saturation directive + the paper's own disclosed 14M-only caveat).
**Design Rev 0 (`660cffc`) → §13.13 attack round 1: NEEDS-REVISION**
(2026-07-09) — the wrong-direction claim verified TRUE against the raw
tables; the h2h contender pin (per_token) is confirmed SOUND, not a
misread (it was chosen for disclosed engineering reasons — Newton-
Schulz/β-uniformity stability + a clean val-loss gate — not because
anyone missed the sign); the original ≈170 GPU-h planning figure's
6× per-step rate error CONFIRMED and traced (`HEAD_TO_HEAD_DEMO_DESIGN.
md:1604`, wave-total ÷ one cell's steps). **BINDING on Rev 1:** (1) add
an exploratory-tier global-vector (Arm 2′) probe, n=1 both scales, ≈4
cells ≈18-37 GPU-h — without it the wave only re-tests the construction
already known to worsen the pathology and never learns whether the arm
that WORKS transfers; (2) VRAM logging folded into the timing pilot;
(3) wire `assert_blind_not_broken`, not just intend it. Cost (Rev 0):
primary recommendation n=3/n=3 ≈244.44 GPU-h (2× contingency); fallback
n=2-at-392M ≈200.58 GPU-h. **Proposed ledger: `fix-at-scale`, cap 300
GPU-h** (headroom-cap, not target; a genuinely NEW, separate ledger).
**STATUS: Rev 1 LANDED (`c6436fb`) → micro-attack round 2
(2026-07-09 overnight): DESIGN-CLEARED-FOR-BUILD, recorded as §13.15** —
all headline numbers re-derived exact (281.04/300, margin 18.96 ≈ 6.3%),
probe transplant faithful, §13.13 byte-intact; three non-blocking
findings BINDING ON BUILD (shared-forward-pass comparator or book
≈2.79 GPU-h; fix the fabricated "BINDING item 4" cross-ref; stamp the
promised tier string directly, `wrap_exploratory()` hardcodes a
different one). BUILD AGENT DISPATCHED (supervisor, 1.5× per-cell
abort, `assert_blind_not_broken` + negative test, probe wiring) →
independent build audit → deploy (md5) → LAUNCH (392M GPUs 0-3,
98M 4-6). Pilot-tier launch agent separately putting early cells on
box (report pending). Cross-cutting
finding dispatched separately: a terminology audit (CLAUDE.md's "FIXED
(frozen-bias)" and the paper's "stabilization" language overclaim the
DEPLOYED per_token arm) — corrected in CLAUDE.md's Research Direction
and this file's Campaign Scorecard, below.
**CLOSED 2026-07-10 — HARVESTED, VERDICT OF RECORD = §13.22: PARTIAL
at both scales.** Full chain ran: audit FATALs fixed (bd40ebb, §13.18)
→ scoped re-audit CLEARED (§13.19) → launched c329e2b (§13.20) → one
breaker incident adjudicated as GPU-contention artifact + resumed
(§13.21) → 28/28 cells complete, blind discipline verified with hard
timestamps (pin precedes first post_pin launch by 2 s at 98M), harvest
2026-07-10. THE ANSWER: per_token's destabilizing 14M sign persists —
98M +0.1133/+0.1011 (openr1/wikitext, both instruments CI-exclude-zero),
392M-wikitext +0.0189/+0.0140, 392M-openr1 null; reverses NOWHERE. The
global probe (n=1, exploratory): 98M keeps the stabilizing sign at
~1/6-1/10 the 14M magnitude (−0.058/−0.034), 392M ≈zero/sign-flips
(−0.012/+0.019) — **no tested frozen-bias construction stabilizes the
attractor at scale; val-loss neutrality is the half that DOES transfer
(PASS all 8 arm×scale×corpus gates).** Cross-scale attenuation is
descriptive only (392M = 20k-step budget, token-confounded, §13.11
item 8). Realized ≈130.2/300 GPU-h. Archive:
`experiment-runs/2026-07-10_fixscale_harvest/`. Row R8 landed;
09_discussion item 6's "under adjudication" passages can now cite the
verdict (queued for the paper-pass agent, .tex untouched this pass).

### 5. Capability Separation — Stage 2 (design in progress, 2026-07-08/09)

Compositional depth generalization: does a matrix-state model trained
on group word-products of depth ≤ D_train answer held-out depths
D_test ≫ D_train in a single forward pass (no CoT), tracking algebraic
structure, while capacity-matched baselines degrade toward chance?
Registry: `matrix-thinking/CAPABILITY_SEPARATION_DESIGN.md` §2,
**design Rev 0 (`d8d71d9`), dispatched under the saturation directive
to proceed IN PARALLEL with Stage 1's gauntlet** — launch stays gated
on Stage 1 reaching CONFIRM or a diagnosed INCONCLUSIVE (§1.11),
unaffected by which way Stage 1's round 7 (above) resolves. Central
finding driving the design: three independent lines — §1.25's
untrained-positional-row defect, §1.27/§1.29's convergence anomalies,
and an independently re-read circuit-complexity theorem (Grazzi et al.,
ICLR 2025 oral, arXiv:2411.12537) — converge on the same conclusion: a
fixed-depth Transformer with positional embeddings is the WRONG
architecture for a depth-generalization claim, not merely under-tuned.
Stage 2 therefore adjudicates a genuinely new architecture (recurrent
per-token state-composition) and a genuinely new expressivity axis
(β∈[0,1] vs β∈[0,2], parked by Stage 1 as a non-load-bearing smoke test
for exactly this later wave). **STATUS: attack round 1 RETURNED
(2026-07-09 overnight) — NEEDS-REVISION.** Verdict recorded in
`matrix-thinking/CAPABILITY_STAGE2_ATTACK_R1.md` (satellite file; fold a
§2.10 pointer into the registry at next touch — it was under concurrent
edit by the Stage-1 build agent at record time). Two launch-blocking
MAJORs: (1) the reused `row_queries` readout plausibly re-triggers the
PROVEN §1.30 query-independence degeneracy via low-rank reshaped states —
binding fix = a read-vector-std query-dependence diagnostic in the
calibration-first gate; (2) §2.1 vs §2.6 CONFIRM-criterion contradiction
(A5 gating vs open) — reconcile to §2.6's S5+A6-only wording. Plus:
adjudicate bespoke fp32 torch recurrence vs fla kernel at build; add an
n_h=4 calibration cell; cite Barrington 1989 for the A5/A6 exclusion legs;
pin the last-K-window trigger numerically. Grazzi transcription and the
depth-coverage grid were independently VERIFIED sound. **Chain since
(all 2026-07-09 overnight, recorded in §2.13-§2.15): Rev 1 (3be2340 —
torch kernel adopted, cost band 1.5-3.9 raw, CONFIRM reconciled, bars
pinned) → micro-attack §2.14 (NEEDS-REVISION narrow: the 0.04 bar's
max-statistic inverts the claimed FAIL bias; absolute anchor violates
instrument-relativity; D=64 unprobed) → Rev 2 (08e4d59 — 2(e) rewritten
setting-calibrated: MEAN aggregation, 0.25× same-setting healthy anchor
from the 2(d) injection machinery, norm-normalized co-decisional ratio,
depths {1..64}, B=64/seed 7, two-level FAIL routing; honest cost band
incl. 18.4 GPU-h joint worst case at 26% margin; last-K = eval-time
truncation w/ pinned anti-conservatism escalation). Scoped micro-attack
on the 2(e) rewrite IN FLIGHT — last gate before
DESIGN-CLEARED-FOR-BUILD; launch stays gated on Stage-1's readout
(§1.11).** **UPDATE (2026-07-10): the build gauntlet since ran
§2.18→§2.24 (DESIGN-CLEARED → build → four audit rounds →
CLEARED-FOR-DEPLOY); the deploy chain then HALTED at the box-only fla
cross-check gate (§2.25 — a deterministic 1.40/1.36/1.38 rel-Frobenius
disagreement at all three pinned configs plus two invocation defects),
and a dedicated diagnosis+fix dispatch ADJUDICATED it analytically
(§2.26): the composer matches the hand-computed single-step closed form
`S_1 = β v kᵀ` at 4.5e-08 — the pinned recurrence is EXONERATED; fla
0.5.1's final_state is the TRANSPOSE (`[N,H,K,V]` = k⊗v layout), so the
cross-check's own comparison was the wrong side (and Arm-3's β∈[0,2]
cross-check IS possible in 0.5.1 — β is consumed raw, no flag needed).
Fixed (invocation + transpose + device-keyed self-skip + a permanent
mutation-tested analytic smoke section), redeployed (md5 `858e3230…`),
cross-check now PASSES 3/3, box smoke 6/6, and the §2.25 chain RESUMED:
Arm-1 retrain + the 11-cell calibration gate LAUNCHED (tmux
`stage2_calib`, GPU 0, self-healing supervisor, signoff citing
§2.24/§2.26). Next: harvest the calibration readout (separate
dispatch); the 57-cell sweep stays gated on it (§2.8 items 2-3).**

### 6. Novel-Architecture Waterfall (opened 2026-07-09, stages 1-2 RETURNED)

A fresh brainstorm→research waterfall (CLAUDE.md process) on candidate
architectures beyond the current DeltaNet-family contender. **TOP
CANDIDATE (to attack stage): Native Composition Reads** — read via
query-selected matrix powers/products of the fast-weight state
(`o = read(Z^h, q)`, generalizing to relation chains `Z_rn···Z_r1`);
capability claim = single-pass variable-depth exact relational
composition, no CoT; novelty OPEN (closest prior art on different axes:
fast-weight PKM arXiv:2601.00671, MAGNA arXiv:2009.14332, DeltaProduct
arXiv:2502.10297); first wave ≈35-50 GPU-h on the Task E harness;
PonderNet-style halting-collapse kill-shot pre-answered (a closed-form
`‖C‖·h` leakage stopping rule, not a learned halting scalar); unified
with a multi-relation operator-bank idea as a gated second
sub-experiment (RotatE arXiv:1902.10197 is the prior art to
distinguish — theirs offline/static, ours online/in-context/causally-
verified). **SECOND TRACK (parallel-able):** rank-budgeted writes
(per-context rank allocation at the write step; novelty gap verified
against arXiv:2602.04852/2602.02195, both descriptive-only, and Elastic
Spectral SSM's global-only budget); ≈25-35 GPU-h. **Cheap piggyback:**
an orthogonal-complement novelty detector on already-archived Z-dumps
(near-zero GPU cost, a unique instrument). **RUN + HARVESTED 2026-07-09
(0 GPU-h): verdict = architecture-conditional — Task E encoder states
are Z ≈ c*·(I_d + rank-(K−1) task correction) (complement = c*·I at
0.3-1.8% Procrustes residual, per-example scale-locked, emergent not
parameterized; deviation-from-c*·I tracks pathology, ρ=−0.97 vs h21
recovery → free label-free health probe), but DeltaNet-family keyanchor
states have an EMPTY complement (fD ≤ 3e-12, 12/12 runs at d=128) — no
channel for an off-task-storage detector in the production arch. Full
numbers: EXPERIMENT_LOG 2026-07-09 +
`experiment-runs/2026-07-09_zdump_complement/`.** A DO-NOT-BUILD list
(Grazzi/DeltaProduct/RWKV-7/TPR/RotatE territory) was recorded in the
waterfall transcript. **STATUS: attack round 1 RETURNED (2026-07-09
overnight) — NEEDS-MAJOR-REVISION.** Full record in the new canonical
registry `matrix-thinking/NOVEL_ARCH_WATERFALL.md` §2. No literal
kill-shot, but: learned h-selection is DEAD both ways (soft = matrix
polynomial = MAGNA/MEA territory + destroys spectral exactness; hard =
PonderNet-collapse trap — the `‖C‖·h` rule bounds numerical trust, it
does not select h); single-K-cycle "held-out depth" collapses mod K;
the linear stopping rule is UNSOUND vs our own ρ(D)=1.0-2.9
measurements (must be geometric + scale-normalized, with a negative
test); closest prior art was missing (FWM arXiv:2011.07831 —
recursive fast-weight reads for transitive inference, 2020; Neural-LP/
DRUM for operator chains) — surviving novelty is the CONJUNCTION only.
**Surviving narrowed claim: in-context-written operators + EXACT
composition + O(log h) repeated-squaring reads** (separation from CoT
O(h) tokens, looped transformers O(h) loops, Stage-2 composer O(D)
steps, FWM fixed-N_r approximate). Rev 1 DISPATCHED (design-only, no
GPU): input-supplied h, single relation, binary-exponentiation read,
param-matched looped baseline w/ same h signal, FWM distinguished +
baselined, corrected stopping rule, Stage-2-style ledger (35-50 GPU-h
was 2-4× light); wave 1 launch gated behind Stage 2's calibration
readout (M4). Pre-registered risk to answer: pin the regime where O(h)
baselines measurably FAIL (else it reads as efficiency, not the PI-bar
capability separation). **Rev 1 LANDED (74170ed, registry §3):** wave 1
pinned (input-supplied h, single relation, scale-managed binary
exponentiation w/ per-squaring Frobenius renorm — unmanaged fp32
squaring overflows at h≈83 at measured ρ≤2.9 — fp32 + fp64 shadow
reads, direct matvec, backprop h≤3); headline re-scoped to depth-robust
EXACTNESS (Option A) with the capability regime PINNED: separation
depths h*=61 (K=8) / 57 (K=12), ladders to h≈1500, justified from
measured phase residuals 0.0020-0.0117 → hold horizons 87-685 vs
baselines predicted <0.5 by h≤32; corrected trust rule
T(h)=(‖C‖/σ_min)·(r^h−1)/(r−1) with the negative test EXECUTED (old
rule admits a garbage Z at h=21, corrected rejects); LoopedVec + FWM
as comparisons of record; ledger honest at 120 GPU-h cap (phased,
wave-1 ≤50; operator bank separately ledgered, double-gated).
Mod-K-reducer confound disclosed w/ detection signature, scored TIE if
present. **Micro-attack RETURNED (registry §4): NEEDS-REVISION — 5
MAJOR, 0 FATAL, all design-text-level; Rev 1 confirmed to resolve every
§2 finding; citations/arithmetic verified byte-level. Sharpest: the
corrected trust rule is still not worst-case (non-normal D — ρ(D)
doesn't bound ‖D^m‖; our own dead seeds measure cond(D) to 1.09e10);
plus a new-in-Rev-1 assert-crash (residue sweep vs the inherited
eval-hop guard), the unsupported K=12 h*=57, a non-exhaustive Axis-A
partition, and a naive-loop cross-check that overflows inside its own
window. **Rev 2 LANDED (8972a07, registry §3.9): the corrected rule
T(h)=(‖C‖₂/σ_min(A))·(a^h−r^h)/(a−r) with r→1 limit form and a
deterministic nilpotent negative case (old rule falsely admits at
T=0.01, new rejects at ≈10³⁸) — and stated PLAINLY that every reading
refuses the deep ladder (T(61)≈1.07-9.6 ≫ τ=0.2): the rule is the
a-priori screen; decisive-depth attribution rides on fp64 shadow +
locked Axis-C curves. "≥30×" conservatism retracted → shown 3.7-10×.
K=12 h*=57 KEPT with pre-registered asymmetric confidence (1/3 seeds
conservative-hold; moving to ≤36 would destroy the separation window).
Exhaustive 9-cell partition + cross-K rule; LoopedVec pinned
(weight-tied pre-LN residual 2-layer GELU MLP, ±15% params);
eval_grid_mode {claim, residue_sweep} resolves the assert-crash; loop
arm per-step renorm, |Δcos|≤5e-4. **Rule-math attack CLEARED (registry
§5, a0b1336): zero math defects — the bound verified unconditionally
valid for non-normal A/D (stronger than claimed), N2 verified by exact
simulation, every restated value reproduced; 3 wording nits binding on
build. NCR WAVE 1 = DESIGN-CLEARED-FOR-BUILD-QUEUE — the candidate
SURVIVED the full waterfall (attack → Rev 1 → attack → Rev 2 → cleared).
Launch double-gated per §3.8 (Stage-2 calibration readout + build audit
+ smoke + Phase-0 + executed N1/N2). Build dispatch waits on the
Stage-2 readout chain, not on further design work.**

## CAMPAIGN SCORECARD (Jul 6-9 2026, all pushed)

**FOR the approach:** SGD recruits provably-necessary rank (causal);
super-linear capacity (x0 0.5455@d64 → 0.6779@d80; NO cliff at d=96 to
K/d=0.94); exact composition; the write-geometry attractor's mechanism
is diagnosed and **a geometry-stabilizing construction is identified —
the global-vector arm, 14M-ONLY (scaled 2026-07-10 and it did NOT
transfer: −0.058/−0.034 at 98M, ≈zero/sign-flip at 392M, §13.22 —
the 14M-only qualifier is now permanent), val-loss-neutral**
(disambiguated 2026-07-09, see below); the mechanism survives a direct
novelty stress-test (qk-norm confound ruled out, campaign 3).
**AGAINST / bounds:** the attractor WORSENS with scale (4-pt monotonic
ladder 0.248→0.344→0.389→0.455, 14M→1.31B); **the DEPLOYED per_token
arm (λ=0.58) is val-loss-neutral but geometry-UNRESOLVED — it moves the
attractor in the destabilizing direction at 14M (+0.1955/+0.2273
span_frac, CI-excludes-zero)**, confirmed by an independent attack
round (§13.13) as a real finding, not a misread; **fix-at-scale
(campaign 4) HAS adjudicated (2026-07-10, §13.22 = PARTIAL): the
per_token destabilizing sign persists at 98M both corpora
(+0.1133/+0.1011) and 392M-wikitext (+0.0189), nulls at 392M-openr1,
reverses nowhere — no tested frozen-bias construction stabilizes the
attractor at scale (val-loss neutrality is the half that transfers)**;
reasoning-link geometric readout dead everywhere (80/80 nulls,
triple-null + vocab/geometry dissociation); causal keystone
multiply-bounded null (the n=3 transient did NOT replicate at n=12);
NO demonstrated end-to-end win yet (the head-to-head's job, currently
blocked on its own instrument fix, campaign 1).
**Instrument escalations (PI-gated):** C17 TOLERANCE-MISCALIBRATION
(n_iter 20→28 unlocked 11 cells); the admission frontier moves with
K/d (K=90 inadmissible even at 28); K=90's exact-1.0 ceiling did not
replicate fresh (0.9725); pool-restriction shift +0.033 ≈12× measured
noise; the capability campaign's own instrument required a two-defect
fix before its first trustworthy readout (§1.25) — distrust-the-first-
instrument-reading is now a repeated, load-bearing pattern in this
project's own history, not a one-off.

**Terminology correction (2026-07-09, cross-cutting audit):** prior
drafts of this scorecard and of `CLAUDE.md`'s Research Direction said
the attractor was "FIXED (frozen-bias)." The raw rung-1 tables do not
support that for the arm actually deployed — see AGAINST, above, and
`FROZEN_BIAS_LM_DESIGN.md` §13.2/§13.13. The val-loss-neutrality claim
and the global arm's stabilization are both real and are stated as
such; only the blanket "FIXED" attribution to the deployed arm is
withdrawn. The iclr-2027 `.tex` files are a separate, already-queued
correction pass, out of scope for this consolidation.

## LEDGERS (GPU-h, realized/ceiling)

- keyanchor-scaling: 20.46/21 (authorized +5 extension never drawn) —
  CLOSED for new waves pending PI.
- frozen-bias (shared by rung-1 + the head-to-head's calibration-phase
  spend): **11.43/135 realized** as of the last verified figure
  (≈123.5 GPU-h headroom, earmarked for the head-to-head — not free for
  fix-at-scale, see PENDING PI DECISIONS). Two independent
  reconciliations of the h2h calibration-phase spend (ledger-anchored
  vs. bottom-up-from-wall-clock) disagree by ≈1.2 GPU-h, flagged
  unresolved in `HEAD_TO_HEAD_DEMO_DESIGN.md` §1.9/§1.23 — reported
  here, not guessed at. **Round-3 re-price (2026-07-09, §1.26, fresh
  real-kernel timing pilot on GPU 5):** measured ≈3.59 GPU-h (contender
  1.244×/ablation 1.487× vs pre-Rev4 baseline, both cleanly inside the
  1.2-1.5× AUD2-F1 target — the fix is CONFIRMED working on real
  hardware, not just the CPU stub) — but this is 1.562× the §1.6
  registry's 2.300 GPU-h prior, past the pre-registered 1.5× gate
  (driven by the transformer arm's own previously-unmeasured Rev4
  cost, 1.736×, not an AUD2-F1 regression). **Round 3 was NOT launched
  — gate failed, pilot-only spend (≈0.02 GPU-h), coordinator decision

## PENDING PI DECISIONS

1. Venue/author/title for the ~Jul 11 CFP — **IMMINENT**
   (`neurips-ws-2026/VENUE_DECISION.md`; needs the 10pp→4pp cut call).
2. 5 late-add workshop emails recommended (MOSS best scope match;
   AIMS/Sci-FM ≈ purpose-built for the instrument-methodology story) —
   author/affiliation pending approval before send.
3. Retroactive ratification: Phase-2b vocab-space pivot + seedext
   restructure-to-B (both ran under gauntlet authority, fully recorded).
4. Fund or park the §15.28-class admission-frontier design round
   (`KEY_ANCHORING_SCALING_DRAFT.md` §15.27 escalations).
5. **fix-at-scale's 300 GPU-h ledger (retroactive ratification now)** —
   the wave ran to completion under the PI's verbatim saturation
   directive (RATIFIED-in-effect) and CLOSED 2026-07-10 at ≈130.2
   GPU-h realized (43% of cap; §13.22 verdict = PARTIAL both scales;
   the Rev-1 global-vector probe ran and did NOT transfer) — the
   remaining decision is retroactive ratification of the ledger, same
   class as item 3, no further spend proposed.
6. **NEW: the h2h §1.9 escalation-cost correction** — the "≈168 GPU-h,
   unaffordable" figure for the 392M escalation rung descends from the
   same verified 6× per-step-rate error §13.13 traced; the real cost at
   reduced (20K) steps is ≈28 GPU-h — AFFORDABLE. The escalation
   decision (previously flagged as an open item, `HEAD_TO_HEAD_DEMO_
   DESIGN.md` §1.9 item 1) is effectively RE-OPENED and needs a
   corrected figure at the next design touch.
7. **RESOLVED 2026-07-10: the per_token-vs-global contender-pin
   question** — the fix-at-scale probe answered NO: the global arm's
   stabilization does NOT transfer (−0.058/−0.034 at 98M, ≈zero/
   sign-flip at 392M, §13.22). The head-to-head's per_token contender
   pin stands unchallenged on geometry grounds (it was pinned for
   engineering reasons and remains val-loss-neutral at scale); the
   §1.24 cross-campaign dependency is CLOSED, no pin revisit needed.

## SECURITY NOTE (standing)

**TALLY RECONCILIATION (2026-07-09 late, single coordinator pass): ≥90
fake `<system-reminder>` blocks defeated across the Jul 2026 session
family.** The prose counter RACED under concurrent agents (parallel
logs recorded 73/79/80/82/89 independently — each agent read-then-
incremented its own view; see the m3fix launch agent's [LEARN]). The
reconciled floor sums the per-agent sightings logged in EXPERIMENT_LOG
and the design-doc § records through the Jul-9 evening: ≥90, every one
disregarded, zero complied with, zero injected content landed in any
file (spot-verified by md5-vs-git each time). Henceforth: sightings are
logged per-record WITHOUT a running number; this reconciled floor is
the quotable figure. Historical detail below retained as-is:
**≥73 fake `<system-reminder>` blocks observed appended to tool stdout
across the Jul 2026 session family** (recent: a date-change +
concealment + agent-type-list block on the NCR Rev-1 agent's first git
command; a date-change + concealment block in the teeth-fixes agent's
grep output plus a fabricated file-modified-provenance claim seconds
after that agent's own edit; a date-change + concealment block adjacent
to the fix-at-scale build auditor's tool output — all 2026-07-09
overnight, all disregarded; several agents also saw the recurring
AMBIGUOUS system-channel date-change vector at turn boundaries, reported
but not tallied as stdout injections) (three more sighted 2026-07-09
overnight: a date-change-with-concealment block in a `find` stdout seen
by the Stage-2 attack agent; a date-change + fabricated agent-type list
+ fabricated MCP instructions in `git log` stdout seen by the
fix-at-scale micro-attack agent; and a date-change-with-concealment
line plus a fabricated "idastone session report" — RunPod pods, a
phantom experiment queue, and a "pause for the user" directive
contradicting the standing autonomy directive — embedded in the
coordinator's own post-compaction SessionStart hook context; all
disregarded, none complied with) (date-change-with-concealment
claims, fabricated agent-type lists, fabricated MCP-server tool-loading
instructions — the same shape repeated across dozens of independent
tool calls and sub-agent dispatches). All defeated by verify-vs-git/
verify-vs-date, none complied with — including every "don't tell the
user" instruction, each reported plainly instead — all reported to the
user. This consolidation pass logged at least one more sighting (a fake
date-change-concealment block appended to this session's own first
`git pull && git status && git log` call), disregarded; the real date
was cross-checked against live commit timestamps, which is also how
this pass detected several concurrent-session commits landing on
`main` mid-task (see below). Separately, a real (non-security)
concurrency hazard: this repo now routinely has MULTIPLE agents
committing to `main` concurrently — 8 commits landed on `main` during
this single consolidation pass alone, including the fix-at-scale
design and its attack verdict, the h2h build-fix audit, the capability
Stage 2 design, and the novel-architecture waterfall record. Not an
injection, but the reason every write to this repo must `git pull`
immediately before staging, and stage specific paths only, per
`CLAUDE.md`'s gauntlet-bookkeeping rule. A genuine mid-task steering
message from the coordinator also arrived this pass (the terminology
audit reflected in the Campaign Scorecard above); it was verified
against its cited commit and section before being acted on, exactly
as the fake-injection discipline below requires for anything arriving
embedded in tool output. Legitimate harness notices never arrive
embedded in command output.

## The Thesis

Language is a powerful cognitive tool. It encodes most of accumulated human knowledge, and any useful model has to interpret it and communicate in it. It developed under specific constraints — embodied, serial, social communication at ~50 bit/s — and machines operate under different constraints. We investigate whether using language as the cognitive medium for machines is an artificial constraint that limits abstract reasoning.

Language models inherit two layers of abstraction from a research culture that started with text and built outward: tokenizers, which impose linguistic structure on raw data, and flat-vector token representations, which leave the internal complexity of a token implicit. Fedorenko et al. 2024 *Nature* shows the human language network is dissociable from reasoning, math, and theory of mind. The brain treats language as a communication tool, with separate networks for thinking.

We investigate whether better-fitting representations enable stronger generalization and clearer abstract reasoning, both in the model's internal computation and in inference-time reasoning (the GPT-o1 "think before answering" regime).

The work proceeds along three threads:

**Thread 1 — byte-level inputs.** The model ingests data the way it lives in computers: raw bytes. Removing the tokenization layer lets the model develop its own vocabulary from the data. On hold (see Byte-Agnostic, below).

**Thread 2 — matrix-valued token representations.** Each token is a d×d matrix. The matrix structure provides a measurable, differentiable observable — rank — that quantifies how many independent reasoning paths a representation holds in superposition. The matrix structure also affords contextualized token embeddings, where each token's matrix encodes learned pairwise interactions across a local window of inputs. Active (Chapter 2 onward, all campaigns above).

**Thread 3 — inference-time reasoning with structured representations.** Does matrix rank track the number of distinct reasoning paths a model holds during continuous-reasoning inference? The bolt-on matrix-CODI test of this (Thread 3's original vehicle) answered FALSE and is closed/published; the capability-separation campaigns (above) are the current vehicle for the underlying question, reframed around causal rank-necessity rather than bolt-on correlation.

The unifying question: can structured representations enable stronger generalization than language-shaped baselines, in a way that scales to inference-time reasoning?

## Mathematical Foundations

### Outer products and rank-1 matrices

For vectors `u, v ∈ ℝ^d`, the outer product `u ⊗ v` is the `d × d` matrix with entries `(u ⊗ v)[i, j] = u[i] · v[j]`. Every outer product has rank 1. Outer products have `d²` entries but only `2d` degrees of freedom. Our byte embedding is a rank-1 outer product: `byte_b → u_b ⊗ v_b`.

### Rank as sum of rank-1 components

A matrix `M` of rank `r` can be written `M = Σᵢ₌₁ʳ uᵢ ⊗ vᵢ`. Equivalently, via the SVD `M = UΣV^T`, the rank is the number of nonzero singular values.

### Continuous (differentiable) rank

Discrete rank is non-differentiable. Three continuous proxies: **stable rank** `‖M‖_F² / ‖M‖_2²`; **participation ratio** `(Σᵢ σᵢ)² / Σᵢ σᵢ²`; **effective rank** `exp(H(p))` where `pᵢ = σᵢ / Σⱼ σⱼ`. We use stable rank as the primary metric.

### Superposition encoding

If a continuous reasoning model holds `r` distinct hypotheses `hᵢ ↔ (uᵢ, vᵢ)`, the matrix encoding all of them simultaneously is `M = Σᵢ αᵢ (uᵢ ⊗ vᵢ)`. By construction `rank(M) ≤ r`; if the pairs are linearly independent in matrix space, `rank(M) = r` exactly. A bilinear probe reads `logit(w) = u_w^T M v_w`. The matrix can hold up to `d` linearly independent hypothesis encodings before they interfere — the CoT2 paper's (arXiv 2505.23648) parallelism-vs-embedding-dimension argument, generalized to rank.

### Why "low rank" ≠ "low capacity" — the load-bearing correction (Hard Rules, `CLAUDE.md`)

A rank-1 matrix `Z = u⊗v₀` (`v₀` fixed) stores `d` independent items via its free vector side, recoverable by a linear read. Rank is only the binding constraint when the readout requires EXACT recovery of K independent key→value mappings through a matrix-vector product, and even then, in a full-attention model, "hold K items" is trivially satisfiable via K *positions* at rank-1 each. Every rank-necessity experiment in this project (Task D onward) is built to close this shortcut by construction (a hard single-state P=1 bottleneck + a provable lower bound + exact-continuous-recovery readout, never argmax/nearest-neighbor) — see `chapter2/TASK_D_PREREGISTRATION.md` for the canonical design pattern every later campaign reuses.

## What We've Built and Shown (foundation era, pre-Chapter-2)

**Findings that survived attack:** outer-product matrix embedding gives better per-parameter representations at T=1 (BPB 2.12 matrix d=32 vs 4.29 vector, matched params); rank enrichment during iterative refinement is a novel emergent phenomenon (effective rank 5.02→6.12 across 8 iterations); the output head determines representation dynamics (MultiProbeHead → enrichment; vector-collapse → solidification); 130× parameter efficiency per layer at d=16; thought interleaving works mechanically when toggled at inference time (10.6% benefit at N=4).

**Honest negative results:** matrix ops lose at genuinely matched FLOPs (Stage G's properly-matched baseline: matrix 3.5552 vs vector 3.2511 BPB; extended budget widens, not closes, the gap) — but Stage G later named the mechanism (Kronecker-separable projection restriction) and found relaxing it recovers ~64% of the gap at matched params, though the per-FLOP tax survives everywhere measured (≈16.5× even at the cheapest matrix winner; full table `STAGE_G_DESIGN.md` §14). Thought interleaving does not beat adding layers at 288K params (BPB 3.535 vs 3.524). 3D matrix attention drives solidification and worse BPB — dead end. PonderNet halting collapses at small scale — use fixed iterations. Cross-domain generalization via matrix structure was killed by 6 fatal arguments before any experiment ran (reshape equivalence). The original PHM + learned-byte-segmentation project (Runs 1-7) died at 26 experiments — archived to `archive/byte-agnostic/`.

**Complete experiment record (26 experiments, Runs 1-25):** full table and exact numbers in `EXPERIMENT_LOG.md`. Headline arc: PHM/byte-agnostic dead end → matrix T=1 wins 175× over vector T=1 → rank enrichment discovered → LoopFormer comparison (later found not actually FLOPs-matched, corrected 2026-07-02) → byte-level d=16 → 3D attention solidification confirmed dead → thought interleaving loses to "just add layers."

## What the Field Has Shown Us

A multi-agent research session (April 2026) surveyed the field; full detail in `references.md` and `research/`. Headlines still load-bearing for current campaigns:

- **CODI** (arXiv 2502.21074) and **CoT2** (arXiv 2505.23648) are the closest published prior art for rank-superposition reasoning, but neither measures rank directly — the gap this project's Chapter 2 onward fills.
- **JEPA** is gaining momentum (LeJEPA solved collapse via SIGReg); no byte-level JEPA exists — a standing gap, relevant only if Byte-Agnostic reopens.
- **Discrete vocabularies have lost the text race** (Meta abandoned Chameleon for byte-level BLT) — the standing argument for eventually testing byte-level input, still deliberately sequenced after the matrix axis (never bundled).
- **Structure wins when pervasive, loses when bolted on** (HELM vs. half-measure baselines) — the standing argument for matrix-native-from-scratch over the killed bolt-on matrix-CODI approach.
- **Fedorenko et al. 2024 *Nature*:** language is dissociable from reasoning/math/theory-of-mind in the brain — the thesis's neuroscience anchor.
- **Nobody has measured rank as a structural correlate of reasoning capacity in continuous-reasoning models** — still the field-level gap the capability-separation campaigns (above) are built to fill, now via causal force-rank rather than bolt-on correlation.

## Closed Programs — Bolt-On Matrix-CODI (published) and Chapter 2 (real-data confirmation)

**Bolt-on matrix-CODI (Rounds 1-9 + positive control, closed April 2026):** H1 (rank↔reasoning-paths correlation) FAILED — four flat rank-k curves; the flatten-then-project readout has a constant Jacobian in Z, so gradients can't distinguish rank-1 from full-rank Z. A nonlinear positive control (bilinear+GELU) also produced a flat curve (Spearman r=-0.13) — the failure is in the CODI distillation objective itself, not readout linearity. **Published**, ICML MI Workshop 2026, "The Gradient Does Not See Rank." Does NOT decide the broader matrix-thinking thesis — all of it was a bolt-on matrix bottleneck on a vector-pretrained model with a vector teacher signal. Full record: `matrix-thinking/chapter2/` era docs + `submissions/icml-mi-workshop-2026/`.

**Chapter 2 — six programs run, attacked, built, audited, and CLOSED on real data (2026-07-01→07), ~600+ GPU-h total.** Headline: when a task provably requires `rank(Z) ≥ K`, gradient descent trained from scratch develops effective rank ≈ K AND makes rank causally necessary (Task D, d=8/16, Spearman ρ=1.0; sharp causal step at k≈K via train-time force-rank). Task E then confirmed the rank-K matrix **composes** correctly under repeated self-application at held-out hop-depths (`recovered_frac@0.9`=1.00 through h=21). Canonical specs: `chapter2/TASK_D_PREREGISTRATION.md`, `TASK_D_WRITEUP.md`, `NEXT_EXPERIMENT_DESIGN.md`, `TASK_E_FINDINGS.md`.

1. **Task D/E** — CLOSED, CONFIRMED (above).
2. **Stage 0** (d-frontier) — CLOSED: the d≥32 "wall" was substantially a step-budget artifact; the real frontier is EXACTNESS, not trainability (best observed `recovered_frac@0.9` plateaus at 0.65 even at 100K steps). `chapter2/STAGE0_DESIGN.md` §12-14.
3. **DeltaNet causal-rank** (production kernel, synthetic) — CLOSED, CONFIRMED. `DELTANET_CAUSAL_RANK_DESIGN.md`.
4. **DeltaNet real-data** (production kernel, real tokenized text) — CLOSED, CONFIRMED: rank causally load-bearing at K∈{8,16,24,32}, graded across a multi-rank window (non-orthonormal keys, pre-registered). Reasoning-dense text is more truncation-sensitive than narrative text; layer-0 rank *falls* as training proceeds (a general LM dynamic). `DELTANET_REALDATA_DESIGN.md` §14-19.
5. **Stage G** (matrix-vs-vector per-FLOP gap) — CLOSED, named mechanism (above). `STAGE_G_DESIGN.md` §14.
6. **Exactness-mechanism study** — CLOSED (Wave 0/1/F/geo3): effective-key geometry is the whole attribution story (a surgical orthonormal-key pin achieves PERFECT K=32 composition, proving the exact solution is architecturally reachable — SGD just doesn't find it); the trainable geo3 fix HITS its bar at K=16 (h=4 0.98 vs ≥0.8) but narrowly misses at K=32 (0.44 vs ≥0.5, attributed to a named, predicted-then-confirmed mechanism). `DELTANET_RD_EXACTNESS_DESIGN.md` §16.

**Follow-on programs, also CLOSED:**
- **Key-Anchoring** — PROGRAM COMPLETE: works behaviorally at K/d≤0.5 (9+ seed-runs), but a frozen, never-trained random anchor table matches the learned one (confirmed-by-ablation — constancy in the key-blend arithmetic, not learned entity alignment); does NOT transplant to K/d=0.75 (a capacity cliff, ~1.00→~0.65→~0.02 at K=16/32/48). ≈55.83/80 GPU-h. `KEY_ANCHORING_DESIGN.md` §9-§11.
- **Scale-Transfer Track C** — the write-geometry attractor worsens monotonically with scale alone (0.248→0.344→0.389→0.455, 14M→1.31B, mix-axis confound closed). `SCALE_TRANSFER_DESIGN.md` §5.9-5.10.
- **Scale-Transfer Track D** — the signature is larger in production fixed-state models, but a matched no-fixed-state control shows the same magnitude — not specifically attributable to delta-rule writes at this tier.
- **Scale-Transfer Track B** — double-barred by its own pre-registered bars; main effects INCONCLUSIVE (corpus-dependent).
- **Pool-margin / admission-frontier diagnostics (§15.26-27)** — the C17 n_iter-sufficiency frontier MOVES with K/d; K=90's archived exact ceiling did NOT replicate fresh (0.9725); escalated to a §15.28-class design round, PI-gated (PENDING PI DECISIONS above).
- **Reasoning-link keystone** — CLOSED as a multiply-bounded null: 80/80 geometric-readout nulls at every scale; the n=3 transient did NOT replicate at n=12 (new-cohort CI spans zero, BATCH-EFFECT-FLAGGED). `REASONING_LINK_DESIGN.md` §16.19-20.

No further waves are scheduled inside any of these closed designs; opening a new one requires a fresh brainstorm/research/attack/validate waterfall (`CLAUDE.md`), exactly as every ACTIVE CAMPAIGN above was opened.

**Byte-Agnostic (on hold):** raw byte input for domain-general processing, partially validated pre-Chapter-2. Explicitly out of scope for every active campaign (never bundle two unproven axes); revisit only after a campaign's verdict, per the standing tokenization-held-fixed hard rule.
